                        <p>James Anderson looks set to be a Test cricketer for at least another 18 months after revealing the England management have asked him to play on until after the next Ashes series.While there has been speculation at times this summer that Anderson, now aged 38, might consider retiring after he reached the milestone of 600 Test wickets, he insisted he has no such intentions.Instead, he has reiterated his belief he still has plenty "to offer this [England] team" and suggested the 700-wicket mark may even be within his reach.</p>
